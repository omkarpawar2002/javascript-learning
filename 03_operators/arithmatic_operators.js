/*
Arithmatic Operators :- 
        Arithmatic operators are used to perform the arithmatic operations such as addition , subtraction , multiplication and division etc.,

        Arithmatic operators are :- 
            1.addition
            2.subtraction
            3.multiplication
            4.division
            5.exponent
            6.modulo

console.log(`Addition of ${num1} + ${num2} :- ${num1 + num2}`);
console.log(`Subtraction of ${num1} - ${num2} :- ${num1 - num2}`);
console.log(`Multiplication of ${num1} * ${num2} :- ${num1 * num2}`);
console.log(`Division of ${num1} / ${num2} :- ${num1 / num2}`);
console.log(`Modulus of ${num1} % ${num2} :- ${num1 % num2}`);
console.log(`Exponent of ${num1} ** ${num2} :- ${num1 ** num2}`);
